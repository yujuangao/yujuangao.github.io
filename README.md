I am Yujuan Gao, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Florida and a Research Assistant at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. My research sits at the intersection of development economics, digital infrastructure, and causal inference, with a focus on how technology shapes human capital, fertility decisions, and socio-economic mobility in low- and middle-income countries. I combine administrative data, field experiments, and statistical and machine learning methods to study real-world policy problems. I also serve as an Impact Measurement & Evaluation Specialist at the Institute for Development Impact, where I design and assess evidence-based programs in education, early childhood development, and social protection.
