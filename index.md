# Yujuan Gao

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Department at the University of Florida. My research field is concentrated at the intersection of Development Economics, Health Economics, and Economics in Education. I use survey methods and experimental design. My research topics examines how public policies and digital technologies influence human capital and economic development

I'm on the job market for 2024 - 2025. I am truly grateful to be advised by Conner Mullally, Scott Rozelle,  Jared Gars, and Xinde "James" Ji, who are kindly serving as references for me.  You can contact me at yujuan.gao@ufl.edu.
