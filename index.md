I am currently a PhD candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Department at the University of Florida. My research field is concentrated at the intersection of Development Economics, Health Economics, and Economics in Education. I use survey methods and experimental design. My research topics examines how public policies and digital technologies influence human capital and economic development.
