      <p>
      This study examines how mobile internet access affects fertility using NDHS (2013–2018) and 3G coverage across 725 LGAs in a staggered rollout. A one-SD increase in 3G coverage reduces birth probability among women aged 12–20 by 1.4–18 p.p. Effects vary by reproductive history: internet delays first births but increases subsequent fertility among young mothers. Mechanisms: delayed cohabitation/childbearing (not contraceptive uptake), increased high-skill employment, and stronger household bargaining power.

      <p>
      Field experiment in 130 rural Chinese boarding schools compares CAL vs. workbook interventions. Workbook treatment generates negative spillovers on non-targeted peers, strongest along close peer ties; mechanism is motivational crowd-out from observing peers receive extra resources. CAL (delivered outside class) shows no such spillovers. Implications: intervention design matters in competitive, resource-limited settings.

  <p>
  Using data on 2,956 primary students in rural China and an IV strategy based on seat assignment, study groups raise achievement by 0.11 SD, especially for males, lower performers, and cohesive groups. Intrinsic motivation mediates effects; optimizing spatial proximity is a cost-effective policy lever.

  RCT among 1,096 low-income mothers finds large gains in parenting knowledge (ITT = 0.222 SD, p &lt; 0.01) and some stimulating practices; heterogeneous effects align with information gaps, inattention, and motivated cognition.
