**Unintended Consequences of Best Intentions: Examining Spillover Effects in Targeted Supplementary Education Interventions**  
(with Conner Mullally and Yue Ma)

This paper presents a novel multi-treatment field experiment that investigates the spillover effects of targeted supplementary computer-assisted learning (CAL) and traditional paper-pencil workbook education interventions among 130 boarding schools in rural China. We also discuss the possible channels by which programs may have spillover effects on non-targeted peers' academic outcomes. We find that the paper-pencil workbook program has a negative spillover effect on untargeted non-boarding students’ school performance, but no spillover effect is detected in the CAL group. Our network interference results suggest that the negative spillover effects of the workbook program most strongly affect non-boarding students who have close-boarding peers in the same classroom.

**3G Network Expansion and Fertility Decisions in Nigeria**  
(with Conner Mullally, Xinde Ji, Jared Gars)

Examines the impact of mobile network expansion on fertility choices and infant mortality using DHS data from Nigeria. The study finds reduced fertility, particularly among adolescents, associated with greater 3G coverage.

**Friendship Formation and Peer Effect: Using Seat Distribution as an Instrument**  
(with Yu Bai and Scott Rozelle)

Analyzes peer effects on academic outcomes using network theory and IV strategy in rural Chinese schools. Finds stronger peer effects among low-performing and male students, with intrinsic motivation as a key mechanism.
