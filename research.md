Using Nigerian DHS data (2013–2018) linked to 3G rollout across 725 local government areas, we find that a one standard deviation increase in coverage reduces birth probability among women aged 12–20 by 1.4–18 percentage points. Effects operate through delayed cohabitation and childbearing rather than contraceptive uptake, alongside increased skilled employment and stronger household bargaining power.

Field experiment across 130 rural Chinese boarding schools comparing computer-assisted learning and workbook interventions. Results reveal significant negative spillovers from workbook treatments on non-targeted students, particularly those with close peer connections. The mechanism appears motivational: observing peers receive extra resources reduces confidence in academic effort. Computer-assisted learning conducted outside classrooms shows no such spillovers.

        <div class="abstract-content">
This study investigates peer effects on academic performance using network theory and instrumental variables with 2,956 primary school students in rural China. Study groups significantly enhance achievement by 0.11 standard deviations, with stronger effects among male students, lower performers, and cohesive groups. Mediation analysis identifies intrinsic motivation as the primary mechanism driving peer effects through enhanced autonomous learning behaviors. Results suggest that optimizing spatial proximity in peer networks represents a cost-efficient policy instrument for human capital accumulation in resource-constrained settings, leveraging existing human capital without substantial additional inputs.

This paper evaluates a text messaging-based parenting program (Tips-by-Text) among 1,096 low-income mothers in 6 counties in rural northwestern China. Overall, our results show substantial, positive impacts of Tips-by-Text on parenting knowledge (ITT = 0.222 SD, p < 0.01) and some critical stimulating parenting practices. While the average treatment effects on other parenting practices and early childhood development outcomes at ages 0-3 are statistically insignificant in the sample overall, we found large heterogeneities in the treatment effects consistent with three behavioral economics concepts: lack of information, inattention, and motivated cognition.
